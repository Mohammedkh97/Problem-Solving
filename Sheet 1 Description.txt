Here is the description of each function:

sum
Purpose:
Calculates the sum of all numbers between two given values x and y (exclusive).

Input:
Two integers, x and y.
Output:
Returns the sum of integers between x and y (excluding the endpoints).
Behavior:
The function iterates over the numbers between x and y, summing them.
2. maxMin
Purpose:
Finds the maximum and minimum values entered by the user.

Input:
A series of integers entered by the user.
Output:
Prints the maximum and minimum values entered by the user.
Behavior:
The function collects user input and compares the values to determine the highest and lowest numbers.
3. SUM
Purpose:
Calculates the sum of a series of numbers input by the user.

Input:
A series of integers entered by the user.
Output:
Returns the total sum of the input numbers.
Behavior:
The function prompts the user for numbers and adds them together until the user signals completion.
4. multiply1
Purpose:
Multiplies two numbers without using the multiplication operator (*).

Input:
Two integers, x and y.
Output:
Returns the product of x and y.
Behavior:
The function uses repeated addition to simulate multiplication by adding x to itself y times.
5. multiply2
Purpose:
Multiplies two numbers without using the multiplication operator (*) using an alternative method.

Input:
Two integers, x and y.
Output:
Returns the product of x and y.
Behavior:
The function uses a different approach (such as bitwise shifting) to perform multiplication.
6. multiply3
Purpose:
Recursively multiplies two numbers without using the multiplication operator (*).

Input:
Two integers, x and y.
Output:
Returns the product of x and y.
Behavior:
The function uses recursion to repeatedly add x to itself y times.
7. reminder
Purpose:
Calculates the remainder of the division of two numbers without using the modulus operator (%).

Input:
Two integers, x and y.
Output:
Prints the remainder of x divided by y.
Behavior:
The function calculates the remainder using subtraction or bitwise operations.
8. powerNum
Purpose:
Calculates the power of a number raised to a specified exponent.

Input:
Two integers: num (the base) and power (the exponent).
Output:
Returns the result of num raised to the power power.
Behavior:
The function multiplies num by itself power times.
9. factorial
Purpose:
Calculates the factorial of a number.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Returns the factorial of num.
Behavior:
The function multiplies all integers from 1 to num to compute the factorial.
10. isPrime
Purpose:
Checks if a number is prime.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints whether num is a prime number.
Behavior:
The function checks if num is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of num.
11. isPerfectSquare
Purpose:
Checks if a number is a perfect square.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints whether num is a perfect square.
Behavior:
The function checks if the square root of num is an integer.
12. isPerfectNumber
Purpose:
Checks if a number is a perfect number, where the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) equals the number.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints whether num is a perfect number.
Behavior:
The function sums the divisors of num and checks if the sum equals num.
13. baseOfTwo1
Purpose:
Checks if a number is a power of two using Method 1.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints whether num is a power of two.
Behavior:
The function uses bitwise operations to check if num is a power of two.
14. baseOfTwo2
Purpose:
Checks if a number is a power of two using Method 2.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints whether num is a power of two.
Behavior:
The function uses division or logarithmic operations to determine if num is a power of two.
15. digitNum
Purpose:
Calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints the sum of the digits of num.
Behavior:
The function extracts each digit of num and sums them.
16. holesNum
Purpose:
Calculates the number of "holes" in a given number.

Input:
An integer num.
Output:
Prints the number of holes in the digits of num.
Behavior:
The function checks each digit of num and counts how many "holes" are present based on a predefined mapping (e.g., 0, 4, 6, 9 each have 1 hole, and 8 has 2 holes).
